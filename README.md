# P4DA: Phase 1 — Data Analysis Foundations

## Purpose
This project is designed to cover the content of "Phase 1: Data Analysis Foundations" (Weeks 1–8) from the [AI & Data Science Roadmap](https://github.com/erencice/AI-Data-Science-Roadmap). The goal is to master the basics of data analysis using Python and essential tools through hands-on practice.

## Scope
- Python programming fundamentals
- Data structures (list, dict, set)
- High-performance computing with NumPy
- Practical examples in Jupyter Notebook
- Built-in dataset analysis with Pandas (Chapters 5–6)
- Data export/import (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- Small practice tasks with explanatory solutions

## Main Resource
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) (Wes McKinney)

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Set up your Python environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
3. Install required packages (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Jupyter, OpenPyXL, etc.).
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
	- `chapter-1-4.ipynb`: Python basics, data structures, NumPy
	- `chapter-5-6.ipynb`: Built-in dataset analysis, Pandas, file export/import
5. Follow the explanations and code in each section and complete the tasks.

## Target Audience
- Aspiring data science and AI professionals
- Anyone who wants to learn Python and data analysis fundamentals

## Roadmap (Phase 1)
- Weeks 1–4: Python basics, data structures, NumPy (chapter-1-4.ipynb)
- Weeks 5–6: Built-in dataset analysis, Pandas, file operations (chapter-5-6.ipynb)
- Weekly small projects and "pass" criteria


## Data & Files
- Built-in dataset: `exercise` from Seaborn
- Exported files: `exercise_data.csv`, `exercise_data.json`, `exercise_data.xlsx`, `built-in-data.csv`, `exercise_clean.csv`
